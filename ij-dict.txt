William Penn (1644-1718) was the British-born founder of the colony (and later state) of Pennsylvania. For the hat, see right.

So then PW could be compared to The Abby of Thélème

book-long	The "book" length of a punt is not the same as its physical distance.  Hal kicked the "baptismal competitive punt" 90 yards in the air, but was only credited with a 40-yard punt.

The ball would be placed at Syracuse's 20, so the "net" on the punt would only have been 20 yards.

deuce	This is the score call when both sides in tennis are tied with a score of 40 or thereafter. The progression is 0 or "love," 15, 30, 40, and "game," but the winner must win the final two points. When each side has won three points, the call is "deuce" rather than 40-all; the next point won creates "ad [advantage] in" if won by the server(s) or "ad out" if won by the opponent(s). If the side with the advantage wins the next point, it wins the game; otherwise the score returns to "deuce." Sets are won by the first side to take six games; but sets must be won by at least two games. (In much match play, best-of-twelve-point tiebreakers are played when the sides are tied at 6-6 games. Thus a set score can be 6-4, 7-5, or 7-6, but never 6-5.) A tennis match is won by the side that takes three out of five sets (more commonly for professional male tennis players) or two of three sets (for women and amateurs).

The phrase here may imply a storytelling technique at odds with the picaresque literary style (i.e., not a first-person narrative or not told from the protagonist's point of view; not without plot; not static in terms of the [anti-]hero's character development; not satirical; etc.).

Now imagine a system in which the two shuttles travel back and forth along their respective axes and flash each time they reach the ellipse before reversing direction. Both shuttles are confined to the ellipse, so that the shuttle on the major axis travels farther (and temporally longer) between its flashes than does its counterpart on the minor axis.  There are two formulas for describing the ellipse , one for the major axis on the horizontal and the other for the major axis on the vertical.

they all in here existed basically as Fourier Transforms of postures and little routines	A Fourier transform is a mathematical operation that transforms one function into another. This type of transform is named in honour of Joseph Fourier.

Leap like a knight of faith	A reference to Soren Kierkegaard's knight of faith. Kierkegaard, a theologian and philosopher, didn't think there could be any logical justification for believing in God.

In fact to Kierkegaard doubt defines faith, because if there were no doubt no leap of faith would be required in the first place, much like it doesn't require a leap of faith for you to believe you're actually reading this wikipedia entry right now, or that I'm not an alien sub rosa manipulating your mind for my own purposes.
