# Infinite Jest Annotations Dictionary

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/frececroka/ij-dict.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/frececroka/ij-dict)

This is a rudimentary dictionary meant to be used while reading Infinite Jest on a Kindle. It incorporates the page-by-page annotations from the [Infinite Jest wiki](http://infinitejest.wallacewiki.com/) and a few character descriptions.

You can find the latest build from the CI server [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/ij-dict/ij-dict.mobi).

Open issues:

+ The coverage of characters in this dictionary is lacking.
+ Many of the page-by-page annotations are not suitable for the dictionary format. This includes annotations for a longer group of words, for instance quotes.
